# WebscrapeTechniques
These materials form an introductory workshop covering some techniques for collecting content from public websites, otherwise known as webscraping.

This workshop was originally offered during the Spring 2019 semester at Rutgers University-New Brunswick through the [New Brunswick Libraries Graduate Specialists program](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist/) and the [Rutgers DH Initiative](http://dh.rutgers.edu/).

Since that time two appendices have been added: one on scraping password-protected sites and another on webscraping ethics.
